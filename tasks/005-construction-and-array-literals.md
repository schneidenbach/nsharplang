# 005 — Construction and array literals

## Execution contract

Work in `/Users/spencer/repos/nsharplang` on the current `systems-language` branch.

Execute exactly one vertical ownership slice. Do not stop at planning, scaffolding, prerequisites,
parity results, or a progress summary.

- Add no C# source, tests, helpers, bridges, callbacks, whitelists, or fallback logic.
- Existing C# may only shrink, route mechanically to N#, or be deleted.
- Implement all new behavior and canonical tests in N#.
- Before editing, identify the exact C# methods, branches, and assertions this slice will delete.
- N# must become the direct production owner. Leave no legacy fallback, shadow implementation,
  comparison route, or duplicated semantic authority for the migrated behavior.
- Tests migrate with the behavior; do not defer them to a later test-refactor task.
- If an N# or interop prerequisite is missing, implement it in N# and continue through production
  routing and C# deletion in this task. A prerequisite commit is not completion.
- If substantial N# code accumulates without a named C# deletion, recut the work inside this task
  and finish the smaller terminal slice. Do not commit an unused foundation.
- Follow `AGENTS.md`: use focused `./scripts/dev.sh` evidence, run the required integration or IDE
  gates, commit with an `Evidence:` block, update the queue ledger, perform any required clean SDK
  repin, stage selectively, and leave the working tree clean.
- Report only after the slice is complete. Include the commit, exact C# deletion, N# production and
  test delta, and gate evidence.

## Slice

Move the construction forms required by the remaining range/index accept set into N# plans.

Own ordinary constructor calls and array literals/creation separately within the plan schema,
including argument/element planning, exact constructor or array type identity, validation, and
emitted stack shape.

Delete the matching C# construction and array-literal emission/preflight branches. Do not broaden
into object initializers, collection expressions, target typing, or generic construction unless
those forms are inseparable from the exact old accept set.

Add native valid, invalid, corrupt-plan, rollback, recursive range/index, persisted-execution,
and IL-shape tests.
