# Issue Tracker — N# Full-Stack Example

A full-stack issue tracker with an N# backend (ASP.NET Minimal API) and a React/TypeScript frontend. This example demonstrates what makes N# different from C# — not just syntax, but semantics.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm run setup    # Install all dependencies
npm run dev      # Start backend + frontend concurrently
```

Backend: http://localhost:5000
Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (proxies API calls to backend)

## What to Look For

Each backend file showcases specific N# features. This isn't C# with different syntax — these are semantic differences that change how you think about code.

### `Models.nl` — All types in one file
- **`union IssueStatus`** — Not an enum. Each variant carries different data (InProgress has an assignee, Closed has a resolution). This is what unions are for.
- **`union IssueError`** — Typed domain errors. Match on the variant, not on exception message substrings.
- **`record` types** — Immutable value types for Issue, User, Comment.
- **`Errors.Format()`** — Exhaustive match. Add a new IssueError variant and the compiler breaks every unhandled match.

### `Workflow.nl` — Visibility by casing
- **`Transition`** (PascalCase) is public. **`isValid`**, **`describe`** (camelCase) are private.
- Zero access modifier keywords anywhere in this file. The casing IS the modifier.
- State machine transitions with clean match expressions.

### `Notifier.nl` — Duck interfaces (wired end-to-end)
- **`duck interface INotifier`** — Define what you need, not what implements it.
- `ConsoleNotifier` and `SlackNotifier` satisfy `INotifier` without writing `implements` or `: INotifier`.
- `NotifierHub` collects notifiers and broadcasts — the duck interface type stays in **private fields** (camelCase), never public signatures.
- `Program.nl` registers concrete notifiers; `Service.nl` broadcasts on create/transition. The duck interface is a real, working part of the app.

### `Service.nl` — Error tuples + private helpers
- Functions that `throw` produce error tuples at the call site: `issue, err := service.CreateIssue(...)`.
- **camelCase `validate()`** — Private helper, invisible outside this class.
- LINQ for queries — N# has full .NET interop, no compromises.

### `Endpoints.nl` — Minimal API routes
- Routes wired to `IssueService` — live API, not stubs.
- Request DTOs as records — one-line immutable types.

### `Program.nl` — Entry point
- The entire app bootstrap in ~15 lines.

### `frontend/src/types.ts` — TypeScript mirror
- N# unions map naturally to TypeScript discriminated unions.
- `statusLabel()` uses exhaustive switch — add a variant in N#, TypeScript breaks too.

```

No `Models/`, `Services/`, `Data/` directories. Flat, like a Go package. Types that belong together live together.
